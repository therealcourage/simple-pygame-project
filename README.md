# simple-pygame-project
This is simple game made with Pygame module in python

If you want to change the game window icon, simply go to line 7 ``icon = pygame.image.load("shit.png")`` and change the png file to something else you like.
NOTE: The png file must be in the same folder in which your python file is located!
